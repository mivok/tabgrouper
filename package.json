  "description": "Tab grouper is a chrome extension that allows you to automatically group all tabs that match a given URL pattern. You create rules for each website saying which URL pattern to match, the name of the tab group, and optionally a color, and the extension will add matching websites to the appropriate tab groups as you browse to them. For example, you could have all jira tickets in a single group, all amazon pages in another, and all google search results in another.",
